# Resolv

DNS resolution via glibc.

Note: If you are only looking up IP addresses for DNS names and don't need other records
(MX, TXT, etc), consider other more portable rust libraries like `dns-lookup`.

This uses `libresolv.so` which is typically configured via `/etc/resolv.conf` to do DNS
resolution.  It allows you to look up DNS resource records of any type (e.g. A, AAAA, MX, TXT,
etc), use recursion (if your system's DNS resolver permits it), and perform the DNS search
algorithm to complete incomplete names and use your `/etc/hosts` file.

## Example

````rust
extern crate resolv;

use resolv::{Resolver, Class, RecordType};
use resolv::record::MX;

fn main() {
    // You must create a mutable resolver object to hold the context.
    let mut resolver = Resolver::new().unwrap();

    // .query() and .search() are the main interfaces to the resolver.
    let mut response = resolver.query(b"gmail.com", Class::IN,
                                      RecordType::MX).unwrap();

    // You can iterate through answers as follows.  You must specify the
    // type of record.  A run-time error will occur if the records
    // decoded are of the wrong type.
    for answer in response.answers::<MX>() {
        println!("{:?}", answer);
    }
}
````

## Limitations

You cannot specify a DNS server separate from editing `/etc/resolv.conf` for the entire
system.

`libresolv-sys` was generated from glibc version 2.33 on linux and may not be compatible with
older or newer systems or systems of other flavours. Additionally, the thread-safe interfaces
are used, which may not be available on older systems. Pull requests which improve portability
are appreciated.

If you need to support a different version of glibc, regenerate libresolv-sys/lib.rs with
rust bindgen:

````sh
  cargo install bindgen
  bindgen --builtins --with-derive-default /usr/include/resolv.h > libresolv-sys/lib.rs
````

Not all NS record types are supported yet.
